Machine Learning Labs
This repository contains a collection of machine learning lab exercises that cover key areas in time series analysis, deep learning with LSTM networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These labs are part of my academic work and demonstrate practical implementations using popular Python libraries and machine learning frameworks.

Lab Categories
Labs 1–6: Time Series Analysis
These labs focus on time series data handling, visualization, forecasting techniques, and applying statistical models for analysis.

Labs 7–10: LSTM Networks
These labs involve Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, to handle sequential data and time-dependent patterns.

Labs 11–13: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
These labs demonstrate the use of CNNs for image classification and pattern recognition tasks.
